        <h2>Recital</h2>
        <p>
            NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises herein contained, the First Party and the Second Party hereby agree as follows:
        </p>
    </div>

    <h1>Domain Registration Services</h1>

    <p>The First Party registers domain names for the Second Party under the following TLD/ccTLDs and services:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A. .QA</li>
        <li>B. .COM.QA</li>
        <li>C. .NET.QA</li>
        <li>D. .NAME.QA</li>
        <li>E. قطر .QATAR (Arabic Domain Name)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Based on this agreement, ccTLDs (country code Top-Level-Domains) can be activated directly by confirming the respective Registration Guidelines and Policies in the ROUTEDGE.NET.QA Web Interface. 
        The Second Party is required to enter into an electronic or paper Registrar-Second Party agreement with ROUTEDGE as published from time to time on the ROUTEDGE.NET.QA website using updated policies from the QDR/CRA web portal.
    </p>

    <p>
        Domain names are registered on a first-come, first-served basis. Simply making an application does not guarantee domain registration. 
        The Second Party must approve policies and make payment. Once all necessary information is provided, we will initiate the domain name registration process. 
        We will send your domain name request, along with the contact and technical information, to the registry.

            ROUTEDGE uses a Web Portal <a href="http://WWW.ROUTEDGE.NET.QA">WWW.ROUTEDGE.NET.QA</a> equipped to connect using EPP technology to accept domain applications from registered Second Party from Qatar and outside, manage domain, purchase associated services, and make payment online using a Qatar-based Payment Gateway.
        </li>
        <li>
            The Second Party acknowledges and agrees that Applications for a Domain Name License shall be made to the CRA/QDR by the Second Party through the ROUTEDGE portal <a href="http://WWW.ROUTEDGE.NET.QA">WWW.ROUTEDGE.NET.QA</a>, on behalf of the Second Party with verifiable contact details.

However, ROUTEDGE will not be responsible for any delays caused by REFUND Bank Transfers or REFUND Credit Card transactions.
        </li>
        <li>
            We encourage all Second Parties or their representatives to provide verifiable contact details every time they intend to register a domain name. A Second Party representative or an organization registering domains on behalf of the actual Second Party should provide an authorization letter signed with QID or a COMPANY-ID for verification.
        </li>
        <li>
            Individual customers can register .QA domains without any documentation.
            <ul>

                    A registered Commercial Establishment in Qatar should register .COM.QA to register .QA domains by providing a valid Company Registration Document (CR/Trade License) issued from Qatar OR a copy of a Trade Mark registered in Qatar.
                </li>

                    If the applicant is a different person or organization:

                        <li>A. Letter of Request signed by an Authorized Signatory</li>
                        <li>B. Copy of Company/Establishment ID to verify the signature</li>

            The Second Party’s name and Company CR number must be specified as per the Company/Trade Mark registration name in the online registration form.

            The ROUTEDGE portal <a href="http://WWW.ROUTEDGE.NET.QA">WWW.ROUTEDGE.NET.QA</a> registers thousands of other domain extensions (TLDs and ccTLDs) for customers. Second Parties buying other than .QA domains are liable to honor the policies of each Registry worldwide.
        </li>
        <li>
            The Second Party must be aware that making an application and payment online through <a href="http://WWW.ROUTEDGE.NET.QA">WWW.ROUTEDGE.NET.QA</a> does not guarantee that a domain is registered or renewed. Occasionally, technical reasons may cause registration to fail.
        </li>
        <li>
            The Second Party must verify with the <a href="http://WWW.ROUTEDGE.NET.QA">WWW.ROUTEDGE.NET.QA</a> portal that the registration is complete and renewed for a specific period.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>3. Registrant Warranties</h2>
    <p>The Second Party makes, and is taken to make, the following warranties to ROUTEDGE and the CRA/QDR when making an application for a Domain Name License and when making an application to renew the registration of a Domain Name License:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The Second Party warrants that they will provide domain registrant information exactly the same as the legal licensee, even if the domain application is made by an individual designated for registering the domain, a company representative, or an intellectual property institution with Power of Attorney or a web designing company.</li>
        <li>Information provided in the application for a Domain Name or its Renewal (including all supporting documentation, if any) is true, complete, and correct, and is not misleading in any way, and the application is made in good faith.</li>
        <li>The Second Party meets, and will continue to meet, the requirements of ROUTEDGE and all CRA/QDR Policies for the duration of the Domain Name License Period.</li>
        <li>
            The Second Party is not registering the Domain Name for an unlawful purpose, including but not limited to:
            <ul>
                <li>Unfair competition</li>
                <li>Defamation</li>
                <li>Passing off</li>
                <li>Misleading any person</li>
                <li>Other unlawful activities (e.g., pornographic content, gambling, alcohol, terrorism-related content)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The Second Party is aware that .COM.QA domain hosting must be done locally in Qatar as per CRA policies.</li>
        <li>The Second Party is aware that ROUTEDGE, with the permission of CRA/QDR, can cancel the Domain Name License if any of the warranties are found to be untrue, incomplete, incorrect, or misleading.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>4. Name Server/DNS</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Domain Second Party has the facility to change Name Servers anytime using our portal <a href="http://WWW.ROUTEDGE.NET.QA">WWW.ROUTEDGE.NET.QA</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            ROUTEDGE, through <a href="http://WWW.ROUTEDGE.NET.QA">WWW.ROUTEDGE.NET.QA</a>, provides an additional service for customers to use DNS zone record changes using advanced DNS management and web redirection with additional fees payable through the portal.
        </li>
        <li>
            Advanced DNS and web redirection pricing is combined and made active using a checkbox with a tick mark. This allows the Second Party to host their website, email, and other services using ROUTEDGE’s DNS services.
        </li>
        <li>
            The Second Party has the option to uncheck the button if not interested in using ROUTEDGE advanced DNS and web redirection services. In such cases, the Second Party must use external DNS services to host and activate the domain.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fees paid for Advanced DNS management and web redirection are non-refundable.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>5. Consent to Use Registrant Information</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            The Second Party grants ROUTEDGE the right to disclose to the CRA/QDR all information reasonably required by the CRA/QDR to register the Domain Name in the Domain Name Registry System (“Registrant Information”).
        </li>
        <li>
            The Second Party hereby grants ROUTEDGE and CRA/QDR the following rights:
            <ul>
                <li>The right to disclose all information relating to the Domain Name in accordance with CRA/QDR Policies and the laws of the State of Qatar.</li>
                <li>The right to disclose information relating to the Domain Name to enable the CRA/QDR to maintain a public WHOIS service.</li>
                <li>The right to communicate with the Second Party via phone, email, SMS, or other media for the purpose of renewal reminders, expiry notices, and service-related messages in accordance with CRA/QDR Policies and the laws of the State of Qatar.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
